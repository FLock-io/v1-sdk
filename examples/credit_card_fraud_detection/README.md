## Credit Card Fraud Model
### What is Credit Card Fraud?

Credit card fraud refers to any instance where an individual uses another person's credit card information, without their permission, to make unauthorised purchases or to access funds. This can occur through a variety of methods, such as physical theft of the card, skimming devices, or through digital means such as phishing, hacking, or data breaches.
Credit card fraud is a serious issue, causing significant financial losses to consumers and financial institutions alike. Moreover, it disrupts the trust between the parties involved in the transaction process (i.e., cardholders, merchants, and financial institutions).

### Motivations
Preventing Financial Loss: By accurately predicting fraudulent transactions, we can prevent them from going through, thereby saving consumers and financial institutions from monetary losses.
Preserving Trust: Ensuring the security of transactions helps maintain the trust that consumers place in their financial institutions and the payment process.

Streamlining the Transaction Process: By integrating fraud detection systems, false positives (i.e., legitimate transactions flagged as fraudulent) can be minimized, improving the overall transaction experience for customers.

### Expect output
The expected output of the model is typically a binary classificationâ€”either the transaction is fraudulent (1) or it is not (0). However, some models might provide a risk score that indicates the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent.
