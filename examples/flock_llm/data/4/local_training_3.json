After displaying pictures of the house for EDify magazine in 2020 and recording a video tour in 2021 for Architectural Digest, the minimalist design and the poor view of the Edmonton River Valley outside became an Internet meme.\nAs a sports fan in Ontario, McDavid was a dedicated childhood fan of Mats Sundin and the Toronto Maple Leafs NHL team. He described his childhood bedroom as \"pretty embarrassing\" for its volume of Maple Leafs memorabilia. Outside of hockey, he supports the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball and threw out the ceremonial first pitch at a Blue Jays game in 2016.\nOn June 21, 2017, Electronic Arts revealed that McDavid would be the cover athlete for NHL 18, their annual installment of the NHL video game series. Additionally, McDavid's unique skating style inspired the Real Player Motion technology used in NHL 19, in which player size and other attributes affect their skating speed and power. In 2022, McDavid was one of several Canadian athletes to appear on boxes of Cheerios cereal as part of their \"Be the Cheer\" promotion, in which customers could write personalized messages to athletes competing at the Olympic Games. That same year, McDavid became the first active professional athlete to serve as a brand ambassador for sports betting company BetMGM.\n\nCale Makar\nMakar is the son of Gary Makar and Laura MacGregor. He was named after former NHL player Cale Hulse. His younger brother Taylor plays at UMass-Amherst, which Cale also attended, and was also drafted by the Avalanche in the seventh round of the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. Makar's cousin Mark Logan also played collegiate hockey from 2015 to 2019 at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Tom Lysiak was his father's cousin. He is of Ukrainian descent on his father's side. Growing up, he was a fan of the hometown Calgary Flames.\n\nAuston Matthews\nMatthews comes from a family of athletes, with his father having played college baseball and with an uncle, Wes Matthews, who briefly played in the National Football League for the Miami Dolphins. His father is the chief technology officer of a manufacturing company based in New Jersey. He has two sisters: Alexandria, who is three years older, and Breyana, who is five years younger. Due to his mother's Mexican ancestry, Matthews can speak some Spanish.\n\nOff the ice, Matthews was enrolled in several online courses with the University of Nebraska Omaha. In late August 2016, he moved to Toronto and began working out with teammates Mitch Marner and Morgan Rielly. Matthews' favorite athlete growing up was Kobe Bryant, while his favorite sports movie is The Mighty Ducks. He is a fan of players Jonathan Toews and An\u017ee Kopitar due to their all around offensive and defensive game, has had his playing style compared to them. In recognition of Matthews' four-goal NHL debut, rap artist SVDVM released a song titled \"Auston Matthews\".

If you find someone you're talking to is looking around the room and giving you short responses, you should try and steer the conversation in a different direction to see if you can engage them.\n- Have a sense of humor: Laughing with other people is a great way to create bonds. You can try to be a little self-deprecating or just make innocent jokes about your situation. But be careful to not alienate people with humor if you don't know them well.

Although there are a lot of nuances, at its core this method uses rewards to guide your dog towards desired behaviors.

In simple terms, Karma is the law of action and reactions. Our actions, both physical and thoughts, are the acts that are put in the world. Reactions can be referred to as their manifestations in the actor's life, i.e. our own life. For example, suppose your mind is filled with greed, evil thoughts like harming another person, and jealousy. In that case, it reflects restlessness as we will never be satisfied, punishments for harming another person, and stress to become like someone else, respectively. For a positive example, a life lived with generosity, righteousness, kindness, and genuinely putting good out there will lead to respect in society and a fulfilled life. Furthermore, Buddhism believes in reincarnation. So the good acts and deeds that one puts in this life, one also reaps the benefits in the next life.

Get this most important tool first.\n- A 1\u201d wide tape measure. Get one that\u2019s 25ft long. The wide width makes it easier for one person to measure long runs or furniture by themselves. A 25ft length will be long enough to measure the longest wall of most rooms and any piece of furniture.\n- A small level to evenly hang pictures and anything else you can think of. It should be about 10\u201d to 12\u201d long.\n- A pair of #2 Phillips head and #2 flat tip screwdrivers. Or, a ratcheting screwdriver with a set of replaceable screwdriver tips. To tighten loose screws or assemble furniture.\n- A folding step-stool that has two or three steps, and can support two to three hundred pounds. To quickly and safely reach those high shelves, hang pictures, and get close to things that are too high off the ground for you to reach standing in your flat shoes.\n- A comfortable-in-hand hammer, to drive nails for hanging pictures, gently tap things together, or break things apart. A wooden handled, curved-claw hammer that weighs between 12oz-16oz will serve most users well. When pulling nails, place a thin piece of wood between the hammerhead and delicate surfaces such as sheetrock to avoid damaged. Good hardware stores carry both.\n- A pair of adjustable wrenches for tightening just about anything. You\u2019ll often need a pair of\nwrenches to both hold and tighten the same fastener. A smaller 8\u201d and larger 10\u201d adjustable\nwrenches make a good combination for most tasks.\n- A utility knife and a package of quality blades. To safely cut open boxes and other packaging, as well as trim paper, fabrics, textiles, wood\u2026etc. The knife should feel secure in your hand and have a large, easy to turn knob to open the knife to change blades. Buy a package of high-quality name brand replacement blades to keep on hand.\n- An extra power receptacle for an emergency or unplanned usage. Always have an extra on\nhand\u2026you will need it.\n- Hex wrenches. Also called Allen keys. You\u2019ll need these mainly for assembling things like\nfurniture. These come in both metric and imperial standard sizes. Both are useful to have, but if you only buy one set, make it metric, as it\u2019s the most common type of fastener used to assemble furniture.\n- A stud finder. Stud finders help you locate the wall studs hidden behind the sheetrock. You\u2019ll need to know where the wall studs are in order to know which fasteners you can use.\n- A tool box or bag. The only rule here is that the bag needs to hold all of your tools. So, you should probably buy this after you\u2019ve owned and used a few of the tools listed previously, and have a better idea how you\u2019d like to store them, carry them and access them.\n- A cordless drill and impact driver set, if you can afford it. All the other tools are more important, but these two tools are incredibly useful and make many jobs go faster and more pleasantly. The drill is for drilling. The impact driver is for driving or removing screws and other common fasteners.

When you say a habit is bad, it actually means the action you take after the trigger event is something you do not want to keep doing.\n\nAn effective way to make changes is to replace the action to something different. To make this alternative action effective, this action will need to also produce the reward that your brain is seeking for. \n\nIn order to find an effective alternative action, you will need to understand what is your trigger and what is the reward. \n\nFiguring out the trigger is the first step. You can try to think about what happened when you started to take actions. One way to find the pattern is to write down what happened. Then, you can look at them to find the pattern. \n\nOnce you find out the trigger, you can try to remind you to change your action after experiencing the trigger event. With your changed action, you will be able to gradually figure out the reward hidden in your old habit. Some actions will not give you the satisfying feeling like old time. After some try-and-error, you can likely tell the new action that actually gives you the same satisfying feeling. Then, you can keep following the new action. Essentially, this new action helps you form the new habit, which suppress the old habit. \n\nFinally, please note that when you are having extra stress, you may find it is harder to follow the new habit and start to worry about picking up the old habit again.

A one way train ticket from Munich to Rome will cost roughly $35 (32 Euros), and take between 9-12 hours, depending on the route and number of stops.\n\n3. By car - Traveling by car from Munich to Rome is also an option. With limited stops, it will take roughly 10 hours to drive from Munich to Rome, but having a car will allow you flexibility to stop along the way at any cities or sites that you want to see. \n\nDepending on your specific needs, all three of these options could be viable ways to travel from Munich to Rome.", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "What are some ways you can stop your toddler from crying?", "context": "", "response": "Give your toddler a hug to comfort him/her; try to reconcile the fight between the siblings if that is the source of conflict; if all fails - cry louder than the toddler", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "Steps to create a chatbot", "context": "", "response": "Choose the right purpose for Chatbot\nDecide the platform where you want it to appear\nDesign a chatbot conversation on a editor\ntest and train your chatbot\nCollect feedback on your chatbot", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "Is Killing is Sin ?

If you believe they are barking for attention, one idea is to make sure you are not rewarding their barking by distracting them with a treat or playtime. By doing this, you are teaching them that if they bark, the dog will get what they want. Instead, you might want to consider a couple items. First, is the dog getting enough exercise or releasing their energy. Increase their stimulation by walking them more, playing with them, or socializing them with other dogs or humans. This added stimulation may reduce their need for attention. If they are barking because they are fearful or anxious, think about what is happening or what the environment is that may be cause their fear or anxiety. Then, try and change the environment or situation so the dog feels safe.

If you bounce while stretching, you can activate your tendon\u2019s stretch reflex, causing your muscle to try and contract while also elongating it, which may tear the muscle or even detach the tendon from the bone in extreme cases.

Some argue that time-average investing in index funds is considered passive investing. Time-average-investing or dollar cost averaging investing means you invest a fixed amount in the index fund recurringly with a given frequency, usually monthly or biweekly, regardless of the fund price. You can set it up with auto-payment or auto-investment through your brokerage and let it build your wealth over time. Index funds mirror the performance of a collection of selected stocks, thus providing a diversified strategy by its nature. SP500 index has a proven performance record that beats most active fund managers. In addition, real estate investment is somehow passive if you leave all the property management to professionals. However, the fact that it requires a certain amount of equity to get started makes younger investors shy away from it. For the younger generation, generating passive income from content they publish on social media has become a popular choice.

Do you have a phone?", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "How do you fix a puncture on a Mountain Bike?", "context": "", "response": "Step 1. Find the puncture\nUsing the valve as your starting point, closely inspect the tread of the tyre to \ufb01nd the cause of the puncture.\nPay close attention to the sidewalls (the non-treaded portion on the side of the tyre where the pressure and size information is printed/moulded) to make sure there are no tears or holes.\nRemove any glass, grit or other debris that you spot. A small flat-head screwdriver or awl is the best tool for this, but be careful not to dig too deep. A small set of pliers can also be useful for removing embedded thorns.\nEven if you \ufb01nd one possible cause of the puncture, continue checking the tyre thoroughly until you get back to the valve because there could well be more.\n\nStep 2. Remove the inner tube\nLet the air out of the inner tube and push the valve up into the tyre, unscrewing and retaining the valve lockring if \ufb01tted.\nOn the side of the wheel opposite the valve, slip a tyre lever under the tyre\u2019s bead and a further tyre lever about roughly 5cm away.\nPull the nearer tyre lever towards you, lifting the tyre\u2019s bead over the edge of the rim. Continue until one bead of the tyre is completely free of the rim then pull the tube out.\nRemove the tyre completely from the rim \u2013 with most tyres this can be done by hand unless they are exceptionally tight.\n\nStep 3. Locate the puncture on the inner tube\nIf you are just going to replace the inner tube, move to step 6.\nIf you want to patch the inner tube \u2013 and you ought to, it\u2019s not that hard! \u2013 in\ufb02ate the tube and listen for air escaping.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to find the hole by listening alone, try passing your lips over the top of the tube.\nIf the hole still can\u2019t be found, re-in\ufb02ate the tube and pass it through a bowl of water, or rub the tube down with soapy water, until you spot escaping bubbles. Be sure to dry the tube before proceeding to the next step.\n\nStep 4. Prepare the inner tube for patching\nSelect an appropriately sized patch \u2013 if in doubt, err on the side of caution and use a bigger rather than smaller patch.\nRoughen the surface of the tube around the hole with sandpaper (usually included with any good puncture repair kit).\nEnsure that any moulding marks on the tube are completely flattened down because these can cause issues when glueing. Thoroughly brush off any rubber \u2018shavings\u2019. Cleanliness is key when repairing a puncture.\nIf you\u2019re using pre-glued patches \u2013 such as Park\u2019s popular GP-2 patch kit \u2013 you can now patch the hole. Thoroughly press down on the patch to ensure it\u2019s fully in contact with the tube.\nIf you\u2019re using a \u2018traditional\u2019 glue-on patch kit, start by applying a generous drop of glue \u2013 or rubber cement by its proper name \u2013 to the tube and spread this across an area slightly larger than the patch you intend to use. Allow this to dry.\nSimilarly, apply a second, thinner layer. Once again, allow to dry \u2013 when the glue is dry, its surface will change from a shiny to a matte finish.\nThe key to ensuring a good long-lasting puncture repair is patience, so don\u2019t rush this step.\n\nStep 5. Patching an inner tube\nFirmly press the patch into place after removing the backing foil \u2013 cleanliness is also key to a good repair, so leave removing the foil until the very last moment.\nIf there\u2019s a thin cellophane backing on the patch, it can be left on. It\u2019s good practice to dust any stray glue with chalk, talcum powder or fine road dust to prevent it from sticking to the inside of the tyre casing.\n\nStep 6. Inspect the tyre casing and rim tape\nBefore refitting the tube, thoroughly double/triple-check the inside of the tyre casing \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more frustrating than going to the effort of patching a tube only to puncture it again with a stray thorn you may have missed.\nIt\u2019s also good practice to check the rim tape. If a hard plastic rim strip \u2013 often found on cheaper bikes \u2013 is torn, it leaves a sharp edge that can easily slice a tube.\nLikewise, if your rim tape has slipped, it can leave eyelets or spoke holes exposed, which can also puncture a tube.\nIf you have persistent problems with your rim tape puncturing your tube, try swapping it out for new tape tape \n\n\nStep 7. Refit the tyre\nAfter repairing the tube and thoroughly checking the tyre, re\ufb01t one side of the tyre \u2013 one bead, to use the correct term \u2013 to the rim.\nSlightly in\ufb02ate the tube (just enough to give it structure) and re\ufb01t it to the wheel, putting the valve through its hole first.\nStarting at the opposite side of the rim to the valve, use your thumbs to lift the tyre\u2019s bead over the rim. Work your way around the rim until there\u2019s just one small section of the tyre left.\nPush the valve up into the tyre and then, using your thumbs, ease the remaining section of the tyre\u2019s bead over the edge of the rim.\nIf the tyre is particularly tight, avoid the temptation to use a tyre lever to push the last section of the tyre onto the rim \u2013 you\u2019ll almost certainly pinch your inner tube doing so.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to pop the tyre onto the wheel, try putting the tyre on the ground, holding it in place with your feet and rolling the bead back toward you \u2013 heavy gloves really help here. This takes a little practice but should work with even the most stubborn tyres.\n\n\nStep 8. Check the repair and inflate the tyre\nCheck that the tube isn\u2019t trapped between the rim and the tyre bead by working your way around the tyre, pushing the bead into the well of the rim.\nIf the tube is trapped, try \u2018massaging\u2019 the tyre to encourage it to seat properly. Pumping it up a small amount may also help to seat the tube properly.\nIn\ufb02ate the tyre to a point where it feels soft but has maintained its shape. Then check that the moulding mark around the tyre follows the rim evenly all the way around.\nIf not, de\ufb02ate a little and ease any high spots down and pull low spots up until the bead is \ufb01tted evenly.\nIn\ufb02ate fully and check once again that the tyre\u2019s bead is still seated evenly and that the tyre isn\u2019t lifting off the rim at any point, then adjust your pressures to suit.", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "List some common citrus-based beverages.", "context": "", "response": "Some common citrus-based beverages include orange juice, grapefruit juice, lemonade, Mountain Dew, mimosas", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "What famous surfers have died while surfing?", "context": "", "response": "There are many surfers that have died doing what they love.

And results continue to improve as you start taking cues from various aspects of the ingredients being used. Most important steps that could lead to quality issues are around managing moisture while protein cooks. Especially when you use chicken. Chicken tends to release a lot of moisture and that can spoil the dish. A recommendation would be to cook all of the chicken 50% through without any seasoning in a separate pot. It'll release significant moisture in this process. Once done, you can then separate out chicken from the stock and use the chicken for Biryani.

It's good to choose a time that most of your guest will be able to make it. If your party is outdoor, you should consider the weather when choosing a date. \n5. What are you serving? Consider if you want alcohol at your party and how much food you will need. If your party is during a meal time, you should provide that meal for your guest.\n6. Is there entertainment? You can provide entertainment like games or music at the party to keep your guests engaged. It can be as simple as playing music from your phone or as big as hiring a band. \n7.

Traditionally, those who run \"runners\" will run 5-7 days a week. Runners will average between 3 miles per run up to 20 miles per run. While running is great exercise and very efficient at burning calories, it can be hard on the body. Specifically the leg joints. The average runner will strike the surface they are running on 1,480 times per mile. So if you are running 10 miles, thats just under 15,000 foot strikes. This repetitive striking can deteriorate the body joints over time. Therefore, the type of surface a runner runs on, can have a huge impact on the body. Some surfaces are harder than others, the harder the surface, the harder on the body, legs and joints. Concrete is harder than asphalt, asphalt is harder than a dirt trail and a dirt trail is harder than a high school track surface. Example, concrete can be 30% harder surface than asphalt. Running is a great exercise and millions of people enjoy running. But if you want to run long, as in for a long time, choose your running surface for the long run.

There are many good texts available and your hospital may even have some on hand. If you can find another parent within your network who has gone through pediatric leukemia with their child, it can be helpful to talk to someone who has been through the experience. Many people also find comfort in support groups on Facebook, or through a local \"Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\" chapter.

Her blood chemistry values measure total cholesterol at 195 mg% and HDL cholesterol at 42 mg%. Her fasting blood sugar is 105 mg%. Roslyn is sedentary and has engaged in no endurance training program since college. Brainstorm an appropriate exercise training program to help Roslyn improve her C-R (cardiorespiratory) fitness. Be sure to calculate a target heart rate range with corresponding RPE.", "context": "", "response": "We can prescribe an exercise program through the lens of FITT: frequency, intensity, time, and type. For frequency, we should aim for 3-5 days per week, with the higher the better the improvements for C-R fitness. As for intensity, we want to aim for 60-90% HRR (heart rate recovery), anywhere from 4-8 RPE (rate of perceived exertion). Since Roslyn is 36 years of age, her predicted maximum heart rate is 184bpm, and we are given that her RHR (resting heart rate) is 64bpm. Thus, we\u2019re aiming for a target heart rate range of 136 BPM to 172 BPM. For time, the duration depends on intensity, but optimally, we want to be working out for at least 20 minutes and at most an hour. As for the type of exercise, we can assess the options that are available and feasible for Roslyn to perform, and choose between weight-bearing exercises (such as walking or jogging) and non-weight-bearing exercises such as swimming or rowing. Another thing to consider is that Roslyn is sedentary, and may need to slowly progress into a more intense workout. A sample exercise training program for Roslyn may first start with a moderate-intensity aerobic activity for 30 minutes a day, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). As she gets more acclimated to the exercise level, we want to progress to more vigorous exercise. According to David P. Swain, vigorous aerobic exercise may result in \u201csubstantially more benefits than moderate-intensity exercise\u201d, which include but are not limited to greater improvements in aerobic fitness and greater reductions in coronary heart disease risk.

I highly recommend wandering through the vendor stands at Borough Market in Southwark \u2014\u00a0it's only open for lunch and you should bring cash because most vendors don't take cards! If you're looking for a high-end restaurant, try Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone. Another popular option is Dishoom: it's an upscale Indian restaurant with multiple locations and worth the hype. And for lighter fare, indulge in the English custom of afternoon tea! You could try Sketch in Mayfair or The Savoy in Covent Garden for completely different experiences \u2014 Sketch is definitely a millennial\u2019s take on tea and it\u2019s very trendy, whereas The Savoy is more traditional.\n\nGrab a drink. You might think of dark pubs when you think of London, but it is also home to some of the best cocktail bars in the world. For a unique experience, find a \"public bathroom bar\" or a speakeasy like Keystone Crescent Members Club. Shoreditch has plenty of options for the imbibers, like Ace Hotel Rooftop and Old St Records. Then there's Duke's Bar in Mayfair, which is a famous spot for a martini since Ian Fleming used to hang out there when he was writing James Bond novels.\n\nVisit a museum. The Tate Modern offers free entry and an excellent view of the city. It's on the south side of the Thames, and you can wander from there to the Shakespeare Globe. The National Portrait Gallery will keep you entertained, even though it really is home to all portraits, but you can learn a lot about British history by reading through the biographies of public figures featured. I also recommend seeing which artist's work the Hayward Gallery at the Southbank Centre is exhibiting, since it's an excellent space. The Tower of London is a classic for visitors: the castle is a World Heritage Site and where you need to go if you want to admire the Crown Jewels.\n\nSee a show. If you live or often see Broadway shows in New York, this might be less exciting to you, but London shows are relatively easy to secure tickets for, and a great activity if you're interested in experiencing even more British culture.\n\nShop.

Greatly reducing the quantity of Co2 in our atmosphere\u00a0would allow more heat to escape the planet and consequently cool it down.

Though there are many strategies to beat procrastination, the effectiveness of these strategies is largely dependent on the individual and his/her/their circumstances. Here are some popular strategies to beat procrastination:\n\n1. Set realistic, specific, and time-bound goals. The best goals should have some built-in time delays, but not too much, as to maintain some urgency. Large goals should also be broken into achievable chunks. \n\n2. Limit your access to distracting media. Making use of your device's focus modes, or locking away your device all together when working can prevent you from being distracted while executing tasks\n\n3. Make the rewards of accomplishing goals tangible and more immediate. A popular strategy for this is temptation bundling, where you bundle a behavior that is good for you in the long-run with a behavior that feels good in the short-run. For example, you may only allow yourself to watch YouTube videos while you are folding laundry.\n\n4. Use support systems. Often, using peers, family, or other individuals in your support system to help hold you accountable is an effective way to encourage task accomplishment. This method also promotes social interaction and continuous discussion of goals with others. As a caveat, you should not become reliant on this method, as it can create burdens on the other individuals in your support system", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "Why can't the whole world be 1 country?", "context": "", "response": "The whole world cannot be one country due to cultural and geographical differences.

Less cylinders are usually cheaper, make the motorcycle more lightweight and thus easier to maneuver. More cylinders make the engine feel smoother, also have more power, but are heavier and more expensive.\n- Usage: What do you use it for? Just for fun, commuting to work, general transportation? Travel? Offroad? Racing?\n- Assistance systems: Modern motorcycles have a range of assistance systems like ABS, Cruise Control, Distance sensors, electronic driving modes for different weather conditions etc. They can make driving safer , but also add weight and make the bike more expensive. Which ones do you need?  \n- Style: There are different styles like naked bike, cruiser, chopper, dual sport, race bike , scrambler etc. Different styles can be more or less adequate depending on your usage, or you can simply pick the one that appeals to you.\n- Size: The two most important aspects in terms of size are seat height and weight. Both have a huge impact on how well you are in control when not driving, for example when you need to stop at a traffic light or going slowly in stop & go traffic.\nSeat height is important , so your feet can reach the ground when stopping.

The key macro implication of indicting a former President is the risk that the criminal justice system becomes a tool to persecute political opponents (former, current OR potential) by whichever person or party is in power. There are several examples of this in other countries throughout history. That being said, there are just as many examples of countries indicting former presidents without any sign of abuse. In fact, it can be an important part of the \"checks and balances\" of a democracy (see France, South Korea, etc.) One of the factors you can look at when determining if the justice system is being abused or not is the number of cases/indictments being brought against the former head of government.

While a country's population is a good identifier for the total selection pool for high performing athletes to come from, it is one of many factors. A country's founding history, climate zone, and GDP are other notable factors in sport performance. \n\nA nations history plays factor as many sports are baked in centuries of tradition. For example, Cricket, which is believed to have originated in England is most popular in countries that were originally British Colonies. Long traditions such as this set specific sports into the culture of a nation, increasing the percentage of the athlete pool that it can pull from and can increase the level at which that nation is competitive. \n\nClimate zone can also influence the competitiveness of a country in given sports. Norway, fore example, earned the most olympic medals of any country in the 2022 olympic games with a total of 37 medals. In the summer games of 2020 (held in 2021), Norway ranked 20th overall with just 8 medals. Norways Climate and Topography have led winter sports to be extremely popular, and Norway has over time developed elite programs in cross country/nordic skiing, speed skating, curling, biathlon, and ski jumping. \n\nA nations wealth will also influence performance in sport at the international level. This occurs predominantly for two reasons. First is that more money enables larger budgets on equipment, coaching, player development, participation in international circuits, data insights, medical staff etc. that over time create a performance separation from those who can not afford these things. Second is access to sports, many sports are quite expensive some examples include snow sports, gymnastics, swimming, hockey, and polo.

There have been many \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d jazz album lists developed by jazz publications and critics over the years. The following is a brief sampling of some of the top-rated albums from some of these lists.\n- Miles Davis: Kind of Blue (1959) Miles Davis\u2019 masterpiece. One of the most influential albums of all time, because of its widespread influence on jazz, rock and classical genres. It is the greatest selling jazz album of all time, and usually the number one pick on critics\u2019 albums rankings. It features a cool, atmospheric modal approach that is immediately recognizable, tuneful and approachable for just about any listener.\n- John Coltrane: A Love Supreme (1964). Widely regarded as John Coltrane\u2019s masterpiece, it is an intense modal jazz through-composed spiritual meditation in four parts. Every critic interprets John Coltrane\u2019s intent and meaning of A Love Supreme differently. Whether you think he\u2019s searching for some form of soulful purity, or cutting out the middle man to speak directly to God, your jazz-listening life won\u2019t be the same after hearing this searing testament.\n- Sonny Rollins: Saxophone Collosus (1957). Sonny Rollins\u2019 breakthrough and best-known album. Rollins emerges here as a true jazz giant belonging in the same pantheon as Coltrane, Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young. His strong and highly rhythmic thematic improvisational voice is on brilliant display in \u2018St. Thomas\u2019 and \u2018Blue 7\u2019. Not to be missed is his powerful rendition of the jazz standard \u2018You Don\u2019t Know Love\u2019 and his lovely solo during Kurt Weil\u2019s \u2018Moritat\u2019 (also known as \u2018Mack the Knife\u2019).\n- Dave Brubeck: Time Out (1959) Featuring uncommon time signatures and mix of Cool and West Coast jazz, Time Out was the first jazz album to sell over a million copies and produced a single, \u2018Take Five\u2019 that became the first jazz single to sell over a million copies. Brubeck described his saxophone player Paul Desmond\u2019s sound as \u201clike a dry martini\u201d. You\u2019ll want to ice up a glass and pour yourself another with each listen to this enduring jazz mainstay.\n- John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman: John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman (1963) is a reluctant jazz ballad summit of giants. Johnny Hartman initially resisted the idea of recording an album with John Coltrane, believing they wouldn\u2019t complement one another musically. Following an after-hours session with Coltrane and pianist McCoy Tyner, they agreed to work together and went in to the studio to record their self-title album that contained the definitive versions of \u2018Lush Life\u2019, \u2018They Say It\u2019s Wonderful\u2019, and \u2018My One and Only Love.\u2019 This is an absolute essential album.\n- Billie Holiday: Lady in Satin (1958) Holiday\u2019s album of Great American Songbook standards  - lushly arranged around her abused, fragile, but powerfully rhythmic voice - is a testament to her professional powers of persuasion and artistic willpower in what turned out to be the last year of a 44-yr life.

There are a number of factors that make up a beers flavour profile and part of the enjoyment brewing your own beer at home, is that you can play around with each of these to change the flavour and character of your homebrew beer. Here are five ways in which you can change your own homebrew recipe to add interesting flavours or alternatively you can alter an existing homebrew recipe shared by somebody else or a brewery.\n\n1. Use different hops\nThere is a huge variety of hops available to homebrewers and each of these can introduce its own particular flavour and aroma to your beer, ranging from pineapple and apricots, to pine trees and woods, to grapefruit pith and lemon zest. By using a different hop in your recipe either from the same family or from an entirely different family of hops, you can easily add interesting and often radical changes to the flavour profile of your beer. However, depending on when the hops are added in the brewing process, you can also increase/decrease the levels of bitterness of your beer, due to different hop varieties having different levels of alpha acids.\n\n2. Use a different yeast\nBesides fermenting the beer, yeast leave behind lots of interesting flavours and can give your homebrew it's own subtle character. For example, English yeast strains can add malty and sweet flavours, California yeast tends to create a clean and crisp beer, whilst saison yeast adds bright and fruity flavours to your beer.\n\n3. Use different grains\nChanging the amount of base malts can increase or decrease the alcohol in your finished beer. Trying swapping one base malt for another, like American pale malts for a British variety, and look for the subtle differences between them. You can also play around with the specialty grains, like using a slightly darker roast.\n\n4. Add fruit, spices or herbs\nFruits, spices, herbs, and other ingredients are a great way to add an entirely personal character to your homebrew. Anything from fresh strawberries and basil to vanilla beans and cardamom can really complement the other malty, hoppy flavours in a beer. \n\n5. Alter your water profile\nDifferent beer styles will typically be best achieved with a suitable water profile, with different levels of minerals to achieve the desired flavour profile. By adjusting the amounts of specific minerals found in your brewing water, beer can be made to taste fuller bodied, sweeter, drier, more bitter, or even sour.", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "What are some things you could do over the Easter break?", "context": "", "response": "- Go camping\n- Visit friends\n- Go out to lunch\n- Relax\n- Clean the house\n- Sleep in every day\n- Spend time with family\n- Go to church\n- Go shopping\n- Play sport\n- Go to the gym\n- Sightsee\n- Take up a new hobby", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "What are some Australian beer brands that have low or no alcohol?", "context": "", "response": "No alcohol beer is very popular in Australia.

In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of all of an organism's genes, their interrelations and influence on the organism. Genes may direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. In turn, proteins make up body structures such as organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. Genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes through uses of high throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes. Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery-based research and systems biology to facilitate understanding of even the most complex biological systems such as the brain.\n\nThe field also includes studies of intragenomic (within the genome) phenomena such as epistasis (effect of one gene on another), pleiotropy (one gene affecting more than one trait), heterosis (hybrid vigour), and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Which of these items should I pack away during the summer: winter coat, swimsuit, hiking boots, space heater, coffee pot.", "context": "", "response": "In most climates you could put a winter coat and a space heater in storage during the summer.

If an adversary can find a ship on the open ocean and target it with a modern anti-ship missile, this opponent can certainly destroy the complex machinery needed to operate a container port or an oil terminal. Consequently, any cargo you want to unload in a war zone is going to need to drive off a ship on the back of a truck....quickly. An oil tanker will be useless, but a RO/RO ship loaded with tanker trucks can unload lots of fuel under austere/wartime conditions. Similarly, a container ship will be of little use without the large, land-based cranes used at most container shipping ports. A ferry loaded with trucks hauling shipping containers can quickly load and unload without the need for specialized equipment. Data from the Iran-Iraq war suggest that a large, 50,000+ ton RO/RO with a double hull is likely big enough to survive a hit from a modern anti-ship missile. A fast ferry that can move at ~40 knots is probably going to be too small to detect from space or shore using backscatter radar.

Gregor Mendel, a Moravian Augustinian friar working in the 19th century in Brno, was the first to study genetics scientifically. Mendel studied \"trait inheritance\", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring over time. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene.\n\nTrait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century, but modern genetics has expanded to study the function and behavior of genes. Gene structure and function, variation, and distribution are studied within the context of the cell, the organism (e.g. dominance), and within the context of a population. Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields, including molecular genetics, epigenetics and population genetics. Organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life (archaea, bacteria, and eukarya).\n\nGenetic processes work in combination with an organism's environment and experiences to influence development and behavior, often referred to as nature versus nurture. The intracellular or extracellular environment of a living cell or organism may increase or decrease gene transcription. A classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn, one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate (lacking sufficient waterfall or rain). While the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal, the one in the arid climate only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "I need you to divide the following into solids, liquids and gasses.

Below is a partial listing, together with some of the ways these are commonly grouped together. \n\n\nArt form | Can be classified as\nPoetry | Literary arts, fine arts\nFiction | Literary arts\nNon-fiction | Literary arts\nDrama / theater | Performing arts, literary arts\nSculpture | Visual arts, fine arts, plastic arts\nPainting | Visual arts, fine arts\nGlassblowing | Visual arts\nCeramics | Visual arts, plastic arts\nOrigami | Visual arts, plastic arts\nWoodworking | Sculpture, plastic arts\nMusic | Performing arts, fine arts\nDance | Performing arts, fine arts\nFilm-making / cinematography | Performing arts, visual arts, media arts\nPhotography | Visual arts, media arts\nOpera | Performing arts, visual arts\nFood preparation | Culinary arts\nFood styling | Visual arts, culinary arts\nArchitecture | Fine arts\n\nThere are also subcategories of many of these art forms, for example:\nSculpture using different materials can have its own subcategory. Some people consider glassblowing or wood carving to be subcategories of sculpture.\nWoodworking has sub-specialties including engraving, furniture-making, and carving.\n  \nThere is also disagreement about including utilitarian disciplines as a form of art. Architecture is a good example of this. It is highly regulated, requires engineering skill, and provides clear useful benefits, so it doesn\u2019t meet the standard of \u201cpurely aesthetic\u201d. Still, it is common to consider architecture an art form, and most people agree that architecture can provide aesthetic pleasure.\n\nAs you can see, there isn\u2019t a single way to classify art forms, although there is consensus about some of the most common groupings.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Choose the word which is different from the rest: Emu, Ostrich, Kiwi, Eagle", "context": "", "response": "The listed words include types of birds that can be found in different parts of the world.

A versatile and well-rounded attacker, from a tactical standpoint, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, due to his ability to both create and score goals for his team, although he is most often deployed as a striker, due to his composure and eye for goal. He has also functioned in a more creative playmaking role at times, as a supporting forward or even as a number 10, in particular in his later career, after losing some of his pace and stamina with age; this deeper position allows him to drop into midfield to pick up the ball, where he can utilize his technical ability, vision, passing, and movement to create space and provide assists for teammates. While naturally right-footed, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is a powerful and accurate striker of the ball from both inside or outside the penalty area with either foot, and is also known for his accuracy from penalties and dead ball situations. An accurate finisher with his head as well as with his feet, his height, elevation, and strength often give him an advantage at winning aerial challenges, and also allow him to function as a \"target man\"; despite his large stature, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is uncommonly agile for a player of his size, and his athleticism and ability in the air have seen him score several goals from acrobatic strikes and volleys throughout his career, which earned him the moniker Ibracadabra in the Italian media. In spite of his size and physique, Ibrahimovi\u0107 possesses excellent technique and ball control, which, coupled with his balance, power, and physicality, enables him to hold up the ball well with his back to goal, retain possession, and link up with other players; he has also been praised by pundits for his creativity and dribbling skills. Although he is not gifted with exceptional pace, in particular over shorter distances, which became more evident in his later career as he slowed down with age, he is also a quick player and a fast sprinter, who possessed significant acceleration in his youth, and was able to clock top speeds over 30 km/h even into his 30s.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Which is a species of fish?

Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptide chains, each composed of a sequence of amino acids. The DNA sequence of a gene is used to produce a specific amino acid sequence. This process begins with the production of an RNA molecule with a sequence matching the gene's DNA sequence, a process called transcription.\n\nThis messenger RNA molecule then serves to produce a corresponding amino acid sequence through a process called translation. Each group of three nucleotides in the sequence, called a codon, corresponds either to one of the twenty possible amino acids in a protein or an instruction to end the amino acid sequence; this correspondence is called the genetic code.[72] The flow of information is unidirectional: information is transferred from nucleotide sequences into the amino acid sequence of proteins, but it never transfers from protein back into the sequence of DNA\u2014a phenomenon Francis Crick called the central dogma of molecular biology.[73]\n\nThe specific sequence of amino acids results in a unique three-dimensional structure for that protein, and the three-dimensional structures of proteins are related to their functions.[74][75] Some are simple structural molecules, like the fibers formed by the protein collagen. Proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules, sometimes acting as enzymes by facilitating chemical reactions within the bound molecules (without changing the structure of the protein itself). Protein structure is dynamic; the protein hemoglobin bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates the capture, transport, and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Categorize these paint colours as \u201cprimary\u201d, \u201csecondary\u201d, and \u201ctertiary\u201d according to the Quiller color wheel.\n\nCadmium Yellow Light, Permanent Green Light, Viridian Green, Green Blue, Phthalocyanine Blue, Ultramarine Blue, Ultramarine Violet, Magenta, Permanent Rose, Cadmium Red, Cadmium Scarlet, Cadmium Orange", "context": "", "response": "Primary: Cadmium Yellow Light, Phthalocyanine Blue, Permanent Rose\nSecondary: Viridian Green, Ultramarine Violet, Cadmium Scarlet\nTertiary: Permanent Green Light, Green Blue, Ultramarine Blue, Magenta, Cadmium Red, Cadmium Orange", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "From the following list, tell me whether these animals are real of fictitious: unicorn, alpaca, kangaroo rat, griffin, centaur, colossal squid", "context": "", "response": "Unicorns, griffins and centaurs are fictitious animals while alpacas, kangaroo rats and colossal squids are real animals", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Identify which instrument is string or percussion: Kendang, Gekkin", "context": "", "response": "Gekkin is string, Kendang is percussion.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Who amongst these are from India: Virat Kohli, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, \nNovak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Andre Agassi, Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting, Anil Kumble, Harmanpreet Kaur, Mithali Raj, Sarah Taylor.", "context": "", "response": "Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, Harmanpreet Kaur, Mithali Raj are players from India.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Classify each of the follow as a Movie or TV Show: Friends, The Office, Departed, The Town, Breaking Bad, Braveheart", "context": "", "response": "Shows: Friends, The Office and Breaking Bad Movies: Departed, The Town and Braveheart", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Classify each of the following water bodies as oceans and seas: Pacific, Arabian, Caspian, Atlantic", "context": "", "response": "Pacific - ocean\nArabian - sea\nCaspian - sea\nAtlantic - ocean", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Tell me if these vegetables are or are not green: carrot, courgette, bell pepper, radish, spaghetti squash, onion.", "context": "", "response": "carrot - not green\ncourgette - green\nbell pepper - may be green\nradish - not green\nspaghetti squash - not green\nonion - may be green", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Tell me whether these are mammas or reptiles: cats, dogs, monkeys, whales, turtles, lizards, crocodiles, snakes", "context": "", "response": "Cats are mammals.\nDogs are mammals.\nMonkeys are mammals.\nWhales are mammals.\nTurtles are reptiles.\nLizards are reptiles.\nCrocodiles are reptiles.\nSnakes are reptiles.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Which items are not allowed when passing through TSA security? baby carrier, empty water bottle, dog, box cutters, baseball bat, bike, axe, cooking spray", "context": "", "response": "empty water bottle, box cutters, axe, cooking spray", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Tell me which of these are great Irish Bands: The Hot House Flowers, The Waterboys,The Proclaimers, Deacon Blue, U2, Westlife,", "context": "", "response": "Ireland has produced some of the greatest bands in the world.

The primary difference between these boats begins with the shape of the hull since many other design choices tend to be dictated by hull shape.\n\nCoastal cruisers, which are generally sailed near shore and in safer weather conditions, \ntend to have a flatter hull shapes since these boats, which means they tend to \"slap\" the water when coming off a wave.  With a flatter hull shape, boat architects can make greater use of the cabin space and so coastal cruisers will generally have a more spacious interior.  The helm (or the outdoor area from which the boat is navigated) is generally less protected and generally speaking, offers greater comfort and ease of moving around.  Safety, protection and expected time away from marinas mean these boats can refill fresh water, recharge batteries, empty waste tanks more frequently and therefore, tend to have lower capacities.\n\nBlue water boats, because they are intended to sail in open waters (hence the moniker \"blue water\") in more unpredictable weather, generally have tapered (or tear drop shaped) hull shapes with heavier keels (generally, lead) and deeper drafts.  With these designs, blue water boats can withstand heavier seas and will \"cut through\" waves rather than \"slap.\"  Generally speaking, blue water boats offer a much more comfortable experience in rougher seas and will have bigger fresh water and fuel tanks and will likely feature generators and other equipment that allows these boats to away for longer periods.\n\nBlue water boats feature tapered hulls so the beam or width of the boat narrows the closer it gets to the water line (and below), leaving less room in the interior cabin than an equally sized coastal cruiser.  Foot for foot, blue water boats will feature fewer berths and will have more cramped quarters because of the narrowing beam.\n\nBecause blue water boats are intended to sail longer distances and will carry more fuel and fresh water, these boats interior space is further restricted to accomadate these practical requirements.\n\nThe differences in comfort, stability and likelihood of capsizing are all captured in mathematical calculations that can provide an abstracted comparison between these boat types so prospective buyers can anticipate the the experiences and trade offs each hull type would provide.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Classify each of the following music genres as broadly popular or niche: Rock, Hip Hop, Pop,   Heavy Metal, Bluegrass, Country", "context": "", "response": "Broadly Popular: Rock, Hip Hop, Pop.

The United States Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FWHA) classifies roads based on functions which are created based on attributes such as speed limits, route length and spacing. Based on the road functions we can categorize roads into the following categories.\n1. Interstates and Arterial System\n2. Other Arterials\n3. Collectors\n4. Locals\n\nThe interstate system is the at the top of road function classification system. They include Highways and Freeways with the highest speed limits and which allow for long distance travel without a lot of interruption. They are constructed using precise standards, signage and with safety considerations. They are also sometimes referred to as Arterial roads as they provide vital connectivity across regions in America. Interstate 95 or I-95 is an example of one such highway in the east coast of the United States which runs from Florida to Maine. The Principal Arterial system also comprises of U.S. Highways, which provide connectivity across regions which do not have an Interstate to support travel.\n\nOther Arterials also include freeways and highways which supplement the Interstate system explained above. They have a slightly lesser speed limits. They typically connect cities and urban areas. Consider them as being minor highways. As an example, North Carolina Highway 55 (NC-55) is a primary state highway artery connecting multiple regional and urban areas in the state of North Carolina.\n\nCollectors are critical for connecting urban population using local roads with the Interstate highways where applicable. They have more interruptions and are shorter in lengths. They also have lesser speed limits (30-35 mph). These can comprise of State highways which connect local roads with the Arterial highways.\n\nFinally local roads provide connectivity between communities, regions, farms and other local areas.

How did the Spanish Empire treat its overseas territories?", "context": "", "response": "The Spanish Empire lasted for four centuries, from the arrival of Columbus in America in 1492 until the loss of its last overseas territories (Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines) in 1898. In its last period, towards the middle of the 19th century, a debate arose that, to this day, still raises blisters regarding the definition of these lands. A part of the population continues to consider that the lands that Spain conquered beyond the seas were colonies, while another part defines them as provinces. That is, like Valladolid, Barcelona or Guadalajara.\nIn the Royal Decree of Carlos V, promulgated in 1519, which was later included in the Compilation of Laws of the Indies, the following declaration of intent could already be read: \u00abThat the West Indies be always united to the Crown of Castile and that cannot be alienated. We order that, at no time, they can be separated by our royal crown of Castile, disunited or divided in whole or in part or in favor of any person.\u00bb\nThe Spanish laws always spoke of \"provinces\", \"kingdoms\", \"republics\", \"empires\" or \"territories of islands and mainland\". In other words, the term \"colony\" was never used in the legal field for the territories that had been incorporated into the Crown of Castile. It was incorporated later and only with a critical and propagandistic desire, the same as it is today when it is used. This is not an excuse to deny that in the Spanish overseas territories there were models of exploitation that could be considered colonial, such as the monopoly of the extraction of precious metals or certain types of commercial companies. One of the main proofs is that the overseas territories reproduced most of the institutions of the metropolis.\nBernardino Bravo Lira, winner of Chile's 2010 National History Award, noted an important difference:\n\"Politically, the Indies were incorporated into the Crown and not into the Kingdom of Castile. This means that they were not considered as simple land, without their own political personality and, therefore, susceptible to submission to a foreign power. They were considered as other kingdoms, similar to Castile and other Europeans, endowed with the same attributes as them. For this reason they were classified and organized under the form of State of the Indies and not colonies. The kingdoms of the Indies had all the elements that then made up a State: territory, population, nationality, institutions, government and their own legislation.\"\nThis means that, contrary to what most critical authors think, the territories conquered by Spain were never considered as colonies devoid of rights. Moreover, its inhabitants were considered, already with Queen Isabella of Castilla, vassals of the Crown like any other inhabitant of the Iberian Peninsula, once the conquest process was completed in the 16th century. That is why the Indies, which have been known as \"America\" \u200b\u200bsince the 17th century, owed allegiance only to the King, who governed through the institutions created for that purpose and which were governed by officials designated for that purpose.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Identify which instrument is string or woodwind: Gravikord, Heckelphone", "context": "", "response": "Heckelphone is woodwind, Gravikord is string.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Identify which instrument is string or percussion: Derkach, Lyra", "context": "", "response": "Lyra is string, Derkach is percussion.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Tell me whether these cities are in Texas: Austin, Houston, New York, Chicago, Miami, Dallas", "context": "", "response": "Austin, Houston, Dallas", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Identify which instrument is string or percussion: Monkey stick, Tzouras", "context": "", "response": "Monkey stick is percussion, Tzouras is string.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Which of the following numbers are odd and which are even: 1, 35, 72, 64, 103, 29, 16, 41, 22", "context": "", "response": "These numbers are odd: 1, 35, 103, 29, 41.

According to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in present-day Karnataka. However, according to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century CE. Achaya states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, in the 8th century, while the earliest mention of dosa in the Kannada literature appears a century later.\n\nIn popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants. The Tamil dosai is softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka. A recipe for dosa can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.\n\nAfter the Independence of India, South Indian cuisine became gradually popular in the North. In Delhi, the Madras Hotel in Connaught Place became one of the first restaurants to serve South Indian cuisine.

Early structural biologists throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries were primarily only able to study structures to the limit of the naked eye's visual acuity and through magnifying glasses and light microscopes.\n\nIn the 20th century, a variety of experimental techniques were developed to examine the 3D structures of biological molecules. The most prominent techniques are X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron microscopy. Through the discovery of X-rays and its applications to protein crystals, structural biology was revolutionized, as now scientists could obtain the three-dimensional structures of biological molecules in atomic detail. Likewise, NMR spectroscopy allowed information about protein structure and dynamics to be obtained. Finally, in the 21st century, electron microscopy also saw a drastic revolution with the development of more coherent electron sources, aberration correction for electron microscopes, and reconstruction software that enabled the successful implementation of high resolution cryo-electron microscopy, thereby permitting the study of individual proteins and molecular complexes in three-dimensions at angstrom resolution.\n\nWith the development of these three techniques, the field of structural biology expanded and also became a branch of molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysics concerned with the molecular structure of biological macromolecules (especially proteins, made up of amino acids, RNA or DNA, made up of nucleotides, and membranes, made up of lipids), how they acquire the structures they have, and how alterations in their structures affect their function. This subject is of great interest to biologists because macromolecules carry out most of the functions of cells, and it is only by coiling into specific three-dimensional shapes that they are able to perform these functions. This architecture, the \"tertiary structure\" of molecules, depends in a complicated way on each molecule's basic composition, or \"primary structure.\" At lower resolutions, tools such as FIB-SEM tomography have allowed for greater understanding of cells and their organelles in 3-dimensions, and how each hierarchical level of various extracellular matrices contributes to function (for example in bone). In the past few years it has also become possible to predict highly accurate physical molecular models to complement the experimental study of biological structures. Computational techniques such as Molecular Dynamics simulations can be used in conjunction with empirical structure determination strategies to extend and study protein structure, conformation and function.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Which of the following are characters from Harry Potter: Hermione Granger, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Dobby, Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, Professor Dumbledore, Luna Lovegood, Indiana Jones, Darth Vader, Jack Sparrow, Terminator, Batman, Superman, Joker, Gollum.", "context": "", "response": "Hermione Granger, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Dobby, Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, Professor Dumbledore, Luna Lovegood are from Harry Potter.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Tell me which of these countries have won a Fifa World Cup Final: Argentina, Mexico, USA, France, China", "context": "", "response": "From the options provided, only Argentina and France have won a Fifa World Cup Final, Mexico, USA and China have not.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Identify which animal species is alive or extinct: Hallucigenia, Fin Whale", "context": "", "response": "Fin Whale is alive, Hallucigenia is extinct.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Categorize each of the following classes as either 'hard', 'medium', 'easy': english writing, math, history, chemistry, physics.", "context": "", "response": "English writing in general is considered as easy, however to master the skills of writing is actually pretty hard. \n\nMath is in general considered as hard in school, since it's less intuitive and requires multiple step thinking process to solve problems.\n\nHistory is considered easy at school while chemistry is considered as medium.\n\nPhysics is considered as hard.

However, a cutter uses two headsails, instead of a mainsail and headsail, and generally includes a bowsprit. This allows the boat to have better stability in rough weather due to the headsails providing a lower center of gravity. The complex rigging makes this boat more challenging to sail than the sloop, but provides an excellent option for an experienced sailor. \n\nA ketch has two masts. The main mast in the front stands taller than the mizzen mast behind it. The mizzen mast stands forward of the rudder post. The ketch has smaller sails and shorter masts.
